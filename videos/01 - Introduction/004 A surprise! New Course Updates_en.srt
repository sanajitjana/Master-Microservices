00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,740
Before you jump into section two:

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,330
Introduction to Web Services,

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,400
I have a big surprise for you.

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,260
All the sections of this course work

6
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,110
with the latest version of Spring Boot and Spring Cloud.

7
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:14,460
Now, you might be wondering,

8
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,280
hey Ranga, how is that a surprise?

9
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,680
The real surprise is that we have now added in

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,320
a couple of new sections to this course.

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,030
This course is being pursued

12
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:26,430
by more than a hundred thousand learners

13
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,160
and to thank you for all this success,

14
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,560
we added in a couple of new sections

15
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,960
on Docker and Kubernetes.

16
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,120
After learning to build rest web services

17
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,090
and microservices with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud,

18
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,570
you will also learn to containerize them using Docker

19
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,960
and orchestrate them with Kubernetes in this course.

20
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,400
Are you excited about it?

21
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,800
I'll see you in the next step with web services.
